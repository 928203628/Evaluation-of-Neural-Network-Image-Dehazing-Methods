# Evaluation-of-Neural-Network-Image-Dehazing-Methods
**This is the final year project of Weijia Sun.**

**result_selfmade:**
This file contains the results using the self-made testing dataset under the epoch 30. 

**real-dehazed:**
This is the file containing the dehazed image using the pre-trained model.

**checkpoints_new:**
This is the file generated in the training process, containing comparison between different epochs. 

**hazy:**
This file contains the compressed images after adding haze to the haze-free SYNS dataset, which is the data used in the experiment.

**hazy beta=30:**
This file contains the original images after adding haze to the haze-free SYNS dataset. In the adding haze process, the beta is set to be 30, which is not used in the experiment.

**hazy_beta=10_compressed:**
This file contains the original images after adding haze to the haze-free SYNS dataset. In the adding haze process, the beta is set to be 10, which is used in the experiment.

**outrange:**
This file contains the transmission map of images from SYNS dataset.

**png:**
This file contains the PNG format data, which are converted from HDR data format int he SYNS website.
